    <h1>Goals & Direction</h1>
    <p>
      This page explains the long-term direction behind my learning,
      not just what I study, but why I study it.
    </p>

  <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Purpose of My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        My goals are not written to impress others.  
        They exist to give structure to my effort, clarity to my learning,
        and meaning to every project I build.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe progress without direction is temporary,
        but progress guided by purpose becomes powerful and consistent.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why I Chose Coding and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        I chose programming because it trains the mind to think clearly,
        solve problems logically, and create solutions that scale beyond
        individual effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology gives me the ability to turn ideas into systems,
        curiosity into products, and discipline into long-term impact.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>My Direction as a Learner</h2>
      <p>
        My learning direction moves from understanding fundamentals,
        to building real projects, and then to designing systems that
        combine logic, creativity, and responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each year represents a deeper level of thinking,
        stronger problem-solving ability, and improved communication,
        both technical and personal.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Connection Between Learning and the Future</h2>
      <p>
        Every skill I develop today is chosen with the future in mind.
        My projects are not isolated tasks, they are building blocks
        that prepare me for advanced engineering, artificial intelligence,
        and global collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hub exists to document that connection clearly and honestly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <section class="section note">
      <p>
        These goals will evolve as my knowledge grows.
        What remains constant is discipline, curiosity,
        and commitment to meaningful progress.
