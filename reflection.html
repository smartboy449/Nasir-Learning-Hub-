      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout 2025, I encountered difficulties balancing school responsibilities with coding practice. Mastering JavaScript concepts such as loops, arrays, and DOM manipulation demanded persistence, and debugging often tested my patience. Nonetheless, these challenges taught me resilience and careful planning before writing code.

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        I have realized that consistent practice is essential to skill mastery. Planning each project carefully enhances understanding and efficiency. Working on small interactive projects improved my logical thinking and familiarity with core web technologies. My journey also reinforced the value of discipline and structured learning.

      <h2>Goals for 2026</h2>
      <p>
        In 2026, I aim to elevate both my coding and English abilities to an advanced level. I plan to consolidate my frontend and backend knowledge to develop professional web applications. Simultaneously, I will pursue world-class English mastery, focusing on fluency, comprehension, and confident communication. The objective is to emerge at the end of the year as both a competent full-stack developer and a highly skilled English communicator, capable of engaging globally with confidence and clarity.
